# OSINT
### Pipeline welders be like
#### **Challenge**:
I just got off a 144 hour shift in the fields doing some tig welding. You wouldn't really understand. Anyways, I found a picture of this welding machine online. I love me some old welding machines so I'm thinking about buying it. However, it would need some parts.

Can you find me an Ebay listing selling some parts for a machine like this? I really just need to know what town the seller says they are north of so I can go pick up some parts for it.

#### **Solution**:
- You were first provided with an image of a beat up welding machine with no logos/signage. The goal was to first reverse image search the image, which would help you find the name of the welding machine. From there, you are left with a red herring webpage & Ebay listing. The challenge description states you are looking for **parts**. I intended for folks to then scour Ebay for a listing that stated **parts** in the title or **parts only**. By carefully reading the descriptions of the listings, one states "north of **richmond**" which was the flag. 

- Shoutout to whoever it was from Virginia that informed me that Richmond is a city, not a town. I didn't do my Virginia geography homework beforehand lol.

### I'm as cold as a wise man
#### **Challenge**:
What is the name of road this photo was taken on?

#### **Solution**:
- Reverse image search basically. It is some random road in Alaska and I thought name was funny.

### I'm not typing all that bro
#### **Challenge**:
What is the name of the town this photo was taken in?

Please provide the full name of the town :)

#### **Solution**:
- Reverse image search unless you somehow knew the flag based off of the title and it being OSINT lol. Essentially just the town with the longest name.

### HE IS HIM!
#### **Challenge**:
Which individual had these items in their home office in July of 2016?

#### **Solution**:
- Essentially just a cheeky reverse image search OSINT challenge. From what I observed from participants, they got to this flag many ways through that was kind of astonishing. This video has been reposted on a ton of platforms in a lot of languages which was interesting.

### Robots
#### **Challenge**:
Beep boop I'm a robot

#### **Solution**:
